# darwincorpus
The text version of all of Charles Darwin's books, from Project Gutenberg.

They're in the "darwin" folder. All files are text files, UTF-8 encoded.

I downloaded these files from here:
https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/485

As far as I am aware, all of these books are in the public domain.
